# Collection of useful Magento 2 snippets

These are some of the very useful Magento 2 snippets which I came across while working with [Magento 2](https://devdocs.magento.com).

You can find snippets by file name as I've kept them self descriptive. You can do fuzzy search in this repo by pressing <kbd>t</kbd>.

I'll add more time to time here in this repository.
